# lieb-revoice-festival

2d game platformer made with Java and LITIengine.

It's about this singer who is trying to find his microphone as he runs along the levels in a music festival camp.

This is being made for LIEB  (Laborat√≥rio Integrado de Engenharia Biomedica) and will also permit to control jumping abilities of the playable character using movement captured by an accelerometer.
